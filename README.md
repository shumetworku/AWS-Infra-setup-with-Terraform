# AWS Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

This repository provisions a secure and highly available AWS infrastructure using Terraform. The setup includes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets, route tables, a NAT gateway, an Internet gateway, an EC2 instance, and optional RDS integration â€” all as defined in the accompanying architecture diagram.

---

## Architecture Summary

This Terraform setup creates the following AWS resources:

### 1. **VPC (`create_vpc.tf`)**
- **CIDR Block:** `10.0.0.0/16`
- This is the foundational networking layer for all other resources.
- Isolated logical network for organizing and securing resources.

---

### 2. **Subnets (`create_subnet.tf`)**
- **Public Subnet:** Accessible from the internet via the Internet Gateway.
  - Used to host EC2 instances.
- **Private Subnet:** Not directly accessible from the internet.
  - Used to host sensitive components like RDS.

---

### 3. **Internet Gateway (`internet_gateway.tf`)**
- Enables internet access for resources in the public subnet.
- Attached to the VPC.
- Connected via route tables for outgoing traffic from EC2.

---

### 4. **NAT Gateway (`nat_gateway.tf`)**
- Allows resources in private subnets to access the internet without being exposed to inbound connections.
- Associated with an **Elastic IP**.
- Positioned in a public subnet to relay internet traffic.

---

### 5. **Route Tables (`route_table.tf`, `route_table_public_sub_association.tf`)**
- Public Route Table:
  - Routes internet-bound traffic to the Internet Gateway.
- Private Route Table:
  - Routes internet-bound traffic through the NAT Gateway.
- Subnets are explicitly associated with appropriate route tables.

---

### 6. **Security Groups (`security_group.tf`)**
- EC2 Security Group:
  - Allows inbound SSH (`port 22`) and optionally HTTP/HTTPS.
- RDS Security Group:
  - Allows access **only** from the EC2 security group for enhanced isolation.
- Implements the principle of least privilege.

---

### 7. **EC2 Instance (`create_ec2_instance.tf`)**
- Deployed in the public subnet.
- Accessible via SSH (for administration) or HTTP (if configured).
- Used as a jump box or application server.

---

### 8. **Optional: RDS Instance**
- Defined externally or optionally within this repo (not visible in current `.tf` files).
- Should be deployed in the private subnet.
- Access is restricted to EC2 via the RDS security group.
